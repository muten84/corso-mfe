try using single spa to compose two components from each application
https://single-spa.js.org/docs/getting-started-overview

 - single spa for example enable to share common code to every application (react or angular or view) and to coexist two app in a single page 

 - another use case could be to link microfronted by routings changes keeping ezecution domain history

 - the simplest use case is to coexist two different components in the same app (in this way an element match a component
 and the micrfrontend could match the parent component of each application).

 In each case the routing depends on the frameowrk that aggregates micrfrontends
